## Plausible Attributes

Excluding taxi, ferry, & flight trips, which should each have their own almost similar tables, but adjusted to reflect their disaccordant attributes.  For example, a ferry table might have a passenger type field with the options: car, foot, freight driver, coach, cyclist.

Herein, the unit of measure of the $CO_{2}$ (Carbon Dioxide) emissions is grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometre.

## A Trip

The accurate recording of

* engine size
* fuel type
* carbon dioxide emissions

requires recording data by trip, not journey.  In brief

* A journey consists of one or more distinct trips.
* A distinct trip is a trip from $A \rightarrow B$ via the same land, air, or sea vehicle.
* Each <abbr title="record, row">instance</abbr> of a mileage data set should represent a distinct trip, taken/started on a specific date.
* Ensure each instance, i.e., each distinct trip, of a mileage data set has a journey identification code;
   * Each journey must have a unique code.
   * Trips of the same journey must the same journey identification code
* Include
  * trip start code [a geographic code that does not betray sensitive details]
  * trip end code [a geographic code that does not betray sensitive details]

<br>

### Considerations

A distinct trip via the same vehicle might be a trip consisting of one or more stops, sometimes returning to the starting point, i.e., $A \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow B$.  Hence, the field

* trip stops {1: $\ldots$, 2: $\ldots$}

might help.  Herein, each number is an ordinal number, and each ellipsis represents the geographic code of the stop.  

<br>

### Decision

A geographic code decision is required.


<br>
<br>

## Business Rate & Value

The business value is

> $\textnormal{business mileage} \times rate$ where $rate \in \[\textnormal{business rate low}, \quad \textnormal{business rate high}\]$

Basically, the rate might be any value between the *business rate low* & *business rate high* limits; including limits.  Hence, a business rate field that records the actual rate paid is necessary.

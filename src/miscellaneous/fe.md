## Fuel & Energy

In addition to recording measures at the most granular level possible, a detailed set of fact & dimension tables summarising the different types of fuel & energy sources is required.  It will ensure that

* each fuel & energy dependent event is recorded against the correct fuel & energy classification
* the correct unit of measure is available

Subsequently, their identification codes can be used to select the appropriate fuel & energy source per activity, e.g., powering a premises, travelling by motorbike, etc.

<br>

Beware

* Of using the classification <b>liquid fuels</b>, it is ambiguous, e.g., it tends to include liquid biofuels, amongst others.

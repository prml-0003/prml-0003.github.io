Climate & Sustainability: Emissions
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<br>

These pages propose a few *conceptual data models* for acquiring the data measures underlying the direct & indirect demands of Climate Order 2015.  The order requires

* The continuous tracking, assessment, and trend analysis of greenhouse gas emissions; by emission source categories.
* The annual reporting of self-defined metrics.
* Forecasting & intelligent interventions; for emission, cost, waste, poor health, etc., minimisation purposes. 
* etc.

In general, if a pair of emission sources have disaccordant features, record their details via separate sets of fact & dimension tables.  It is straightforward to 

1. Extract a variety of aggregates from such data sets.
2. Continuously summarise a variety of metrics; in compliance with the self-defined metrics reporting request.
3. Conduct a variety of decision augmenting modelling & analysis; in aid of proactive emission, cost, waste, etc., minimisation expectations.

via well structured, highly granular, integrious, disaggregated raw measures.

## Conceptual Structures

There are separate sections for mileage and premises; the miscellaneous section discusses listed bodies, and briefly outlines the need for fuel & energy reference tables.  There are examples of a scope, and units, table within [_data](_data).

## Emission Source Categories

The most confusing aspect of the Sustainable Scotland Network reports is the occasional conflation of the emission source with energy source.  A few emission source categories

* Premises/Buildings: 
  * Powering (via grid electricity, onsite renewable electricity, etc.)
  * Heating (via natural gas, wood pellets, etc.)
* Transport: 
  * Disaggregated by vehicle type, powering fuel, and more.
* Medical Gas
* Refrigerant
* Transmission & Distribution {of Grid Electricity, District Heat & Steam, Renewable Heat, Renewable Electricity}
* Equipment
* Water
* Waste

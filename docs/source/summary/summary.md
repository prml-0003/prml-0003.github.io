**Climate & Sustainability: Emissions**

<br>

These pages propose a few *conceptual data models* for acquiring the data measures underlying the direct & indirect demands of Climate Order 2015.  The order requires

<ul class="disc">
  <li class="disc">The continuous tracking, assessment, and trend analysis of greenhouse gas emissions; by emission source categories.</li>
  <li class="disc">The annual reporting of self-defined metrics.</li>
  <li class="disc">Forecasting & intelligent interventions; for emission, cost, waste, poor health, etc., minimisation purposes. </li>
  <li class="disc">etc.</li>
</ul>

<br>

In general, if a pair of emission sources have disaccordant features, record their details via separate sets of fact & dimension tables.  It is straightforward to 

1. Extract a variety of aggregates from such data sets.
2. Continuously summarise a variety of metrics; in compliance with the self-defined metrics reporting request.
3. Conduct a variety of decision augmenting modelling & analysis; in aid of proactive emission, cost, waste, etc., minimisation expectations.

via well structured, highly granular, integrious, disaggregated raw measures.

## Conceptual Structures

There are separate sections for mileage and premises; the miscellaneous section discusses listed bodies, and briefly outlines the need for fuel & energy reference tables.  There are examples of a scope, and units, table within [_data](https://github.com/prml-0003/prml-0003.github.io/tree/master/_data).

## Emission Source Categories

The most confusing aspect of the Sustainable Scotland Network reports is the occasional conflation of the emission source with energy source.  A few emission source categories

<ul class="disc">
  <li class="disc">Premises/Buildings:
    <ul style="margin-left: 35px;">
      <li style="list-style: circle;">Powering (via grid electricity, onsite renewable electricity, etc.)</li>
      <li style="list-style: circle;">Heating (via natural gas, wood pellets, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="disc">Transport:
    <ul style="margin-left: 35px;"><li style="list-style: circle;">Disaggregated by vehicle type, powering fuel, and more.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li class="disc">Medical Gas</li>
  <li class="disc">Refrigerant</li>
  <li class="disc">Transmission & Distribution {of Grid Electricity, District Heat & Steam, Renewable Heat, Renewable Electricity}</li>
  <li class="disc">Equipment</li>
  <li class="disc">Water</li>
  <li class="disc">Waste</li>
</ul>

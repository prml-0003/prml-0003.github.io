# Fuel & Energy

In addition to recording measures at the most granular level possible, a detailed set of fact & dimension tables summarising the different types of fuel & energy sources is required.  It will ensure that

<ul class="disc">
  <li class="disc">each fuel & energy dependent event is recorded against the correct fuel & energy classification</li>
  <li class="disc">the correct unit of measure is available</li>
</ul>

Subsequently, their identification codes can be used to select the appropriate fuel & energy source per activity, e.g., powering a premises, travelling by motorbike, etc. **Beware**

>&ctdot; the term/classification <b>liquid fuels</b> is ambiguous, e.g., sometimes it include liquid biofuels, sometimes it does not.
